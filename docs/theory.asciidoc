== Names and Symbols

*Taijiquan*, or mostly shortened to just *Taiji*, is the correct way of writing it based on the current, official link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin[Pinyin ]transcription system published by the Chinese government in the 1950s. You might come across quite often outdated written forms like *Tai Chi Chuan* or *Taichiquan* or *T'ai chi ch'Å«an* which all basically referred to the same, but using the old, outdated link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade%E2%80%93Giles[Wade-Giles] transcription system. A transcription system tries to transfer the Chinese written language (the symbol doesn't relate to the way it is pronounced) into our phonetic writing systems, which can be quite a hard task to do because of the differences.

Literally it can be translated to *Principle of Yin and Yang*. To be precise:

* Tai - Supreme ultimate; like the main, center pole of a building holding the roof in its place.
* Ji - Principle.
* Quan - Literally fist, referring to boxing, or martial arts in general.

The name Taijiquan is actually very recent invention (20th century) as it had many different names before that, along: Long boxing, shadow boxing, etc.

== Martial Art

Taijiquan is a so-called internal martial art (_neijia_), referring to its emphasize on developing soft, internal energy (_jin_) rather then rigid, brute external force (_li_). And also for it's past secrecy, being taught only to people within (the family, the clan) in order to keep it inside.

Next to Taijiquan being a martial art, it can be considered:

* *Applied Philosophy* - Instead of just intellectualizing about theory, it is translated and experienced in movement.
* *Dynamic Meditation* - Instead of a static, still position, we are working with attention, intention and focus while moving.
* *Self Cultivation* - Like QiGong its original intention was to lead to eternal life.
* *Spiritual Practice* - Embodying the universal forces within yourself.
* *Health Gymnastics* - Working on the physical and "energetic" body.
* *Gentle Workout* - Especially legs and butt due to the low stance, improving balance and body awareness in general.

== Philosophy

Chinese martial arts (as well as the culture in general) are built upon three basic philosophical streams:

. Daoism
. Confucianism
. (Chan) Buddhism
