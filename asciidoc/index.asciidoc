= Welcome to the Taiji Wiki

== Abstract

Along my path of a Taijiquan practitioner I cam along many, many fascinating details about this amazing martial art. This is an attempt to collect and persist some of it. For my own purpose and also to share with you.

// TODO what is this about? why? what to expect, what not? goal on how to write?
//mehr theoretisch/analytisch; compensating lack of didaktik
//skills; klassische fragen von schueler covern; moeglichst stil offen, prinzip wichtig (nicht praezise
//positionierungen, das ist mehr konkrete strategie); building bridges to modern science (psychologie, neuroscience;
//entscheidung bevor wir bewusst sind)
//* christoph's taiji wiki, intention: mein wissen persistieren; meine persoenliche meinung/erfahrung, keine
//universellheit/umfassend, kein allgemeines wiki schaffbar (und hab auch nicht die kompetenz), zuviel parallstehende
//meinungen (die widersprechen); nicht alle stile;
